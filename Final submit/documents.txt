task 1:
I comment out details, you can easily understand.

task 2:

frist of all you need to a key to login for secure authentication.
if you enter 1 then you can add a username and when a username you will give instantly a random password will generate and save in passwords.txt in encrypted form along with username. 
If you enter 2 and give a username , if that username exists in passwords.txt then you will see the username with password.
If you enter 3 then you can delete a user if that name exist in passwords.txt.
if you enter 4 then all the data which is in currently passwords.txt that will copy to a passwords_load_plaintext.txt which will user readable, you will clearly see all the username and passwords. 
if you enter 5 then all the the which is in passwords_loads_plaintext.txt you will see as output. if you don't enter 4 , means don't save anything in passwords_load_plaintext.txt then you will see nothing here.

And essentially all the error handlings are implemented. No user can enter unvalid input such as letter, string or numbers which aren't in range 1 to 6.
I also commentedout the secure Coding practice in the end of code. I also commented before every functionality and have been follow the given structure.

I think you will be happy and all of your requirments have been fullfill perfectly.
